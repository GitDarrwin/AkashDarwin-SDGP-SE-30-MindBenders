To use TensorFlow Lite in Flutter, you can use the tflite package, which provides an easy-to-use API for loading and running TensorFlow Lite models. You will need to provide two files: the model file (.tflite), which contains the pre-trained machine learning model, and the label file, which contains the labels corresponding to the output classes of the model.

Once you have loaded the model and label files using the tflite package, you can feed input data to the model and get the predicted output classes. You can also customize the input and output tensor shapes, data types, and other parameters to optimize the performance of your application.

Overall, TensorFlow Lite is a powerful tool for developing machine learning applications on mobile and embedded devices, and the tflite package makes it easy to integrate with Flutter.
